Whenever you ship something to be used by others you take on a responsibilty.
Unfortunately not always is this responsibility taken care of.
One thing to make sure you take it on is to write tests.

No matter how small - no matter how simple there should be tests.
**Yes I know reality hit's hard and there will be many cases where that doesn't happen - but strife for it**

### Disclaimer
We are going to make a simple version of an accessible input.

We do it so we can see all the places where our testing workflow can shine.
